# Notes
Personal journal in terminal.

**This is still work-in-progress. Please check back in a while!**

This project is inspired by [jrnl](https://github.com/maebert/jrnl), although it aims at more interactive behavior.

Also, it's a way to improve my Rust skills.

# Incoming features

* Journal entries or quick notes in terminal (obviously).
* Optional encryption.
* Some nice way of searching the entries.

# More random ideas

* Data probably kept in text file.
* More interfaces, perhaps NCurses or web.
